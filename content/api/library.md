# Library API

All library items are identified by an [universally unique identifier][0] (UUID), each 36 characters long.

## Groups

### List groups

```
GET /api/v1/library/sourcegroups/
GET /api/v1/library/metricgroups/
```

Returns an array of objects listing the available groups.

Optional parameters:

 * `filter` (type _string_): the [pattern](/api/#filter-patterns) to apply on group names
 * `limit` (type _integer_): the maximum number of items to return
 * `offset` (type _integer_): the offset to start fetching from

Response:

```javascript

        "modified": "2013-01-02T12:34:56+01:00"
    }
]
```

A `X-Total-Records` HTTP header containing the total number of records is returned along with the response.

### Get a single group

```
GET /api/v1/library/sourcegroups/<id>
