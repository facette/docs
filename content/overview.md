# Overview

## Introduction

Facette is a graphing web front-end.

At its current development state, Facette only supports RRD files as back-end and has originally been developed as a
Collectd front-end. But it is planned to have more back-end support in the future (e.g. Whisper or Graphite).

Its code is available at [Github][0], and is licensed under the terms of the [BSD license][1].

<i class="fa fa-warning"></i> Important: Facette is currently under development and is **not ready** for a production
environment.
