# Overview

Facette is a web application to display time series data from various sources — such as [collectd][0] or
[Graphite][1] — on graphs in a web application, designed to be easy to setup and to use. To learn more about its
architecture, read [this page](/docs/architecture/).

The source code is available on [Github][2], licensed under the terms of the [BSD license][3]. Contributions are
welcome, but please open an issue at Github to discuss the issue or feature **before** sending any pull request.

<span class="fa fa-warning"></span> Important: Facette is currently under development and is **not ready** for
a production environment. Please report any issue on [Github][4].
