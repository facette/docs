# Overview

## Introduction

Facette is a software to display time series data from several various sources — such as [collectd][0] or
[Graphite][1] — on graphs in a web application, designed to be easy to setup and to use. To learn more on its architecture, read [this page](/docs/architecture/).

The source code is available at [Github][2], licensed under the terms of the [BSD license][3].
