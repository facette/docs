# Overview

## Introduction

Facette is a graphing web front-end.

Facette had originally been developed as a Collectd front-end. And, at its current development state, only supports
retrieving data from RRD files and Graphite backends through its connectors. But it is planned to provide more
connectors in the future.

Its code is available at [Github][0], and is licensed under the terms of the [BSD license][1].

<span class="fa fa-warning"></span> Important: Facette is currently under development and is **not ready** for a production
environment.
