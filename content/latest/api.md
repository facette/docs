# API Documentation

This documentation describes the RESTful HTTP API exposed by the Facette back-end on which the front-end relies.

Unless otherwise stated, all requests and responses bodies use `application/json` as `Content-Type`. The format is
described in the [RFC 4627][0] document.

## Dates and Times

All dates handled and returned by the API are using the [RFC 3399][1] timestamp format.

Some API enpoints accept a `range` parameter giving the `[-]<number>{y,mo,d,h,m,s}` format. For example, the "last day"
can be expressed with the following expressions:

 * `-1d`
 * `-24h`
 * `-1440m`
 * `-86400s`

It is also possible to combine multiple units, such as `-1h 30m`.

## Filter Patterns

Some API enpoints accept an optional `filter` parameter, its value can take one of the following forms:

 * a [glob][2] pattern (e.g. `glob:host*`)
 * a [regexp][3] pattern (e.g. `regexp:host[13]\.example\.net`)
 * a simple value (e.g. `host1.example.net`)

## Message Responses

If the API is unable to handle a specific request or if any error occurred during its processing, a JSON message
response with additional context is sent along with an proper HTTP status code.

For example, requesting an unknown item (e.g. collection, graphâ€¦) upon the API, with an HTTP status code being
`404 Not Found`, the response body will contain:

```javascript
{
   "message": "item not found"
}
```
