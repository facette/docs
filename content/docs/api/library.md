# Library API

All library items are identified by an [universally unique identifier][0] (UUID), each 36 characters long.

## Groups

### List groups

```
GET /library/sourcegroups/
GET /library/metricgroups/
```

Returns an array of objects listing the available groups.

Optional parameters:

 * __filter:__ the [pattern](/docs/api/#filter-patterns) to apply on group names (type: `string`)
 * __limit:__ the maximum number of items to return (type: `integer`)
 * __offset:__ the offset to start fetching from (type: `integer`)

Response:

```javascript
[
    {
        "id": "386c8361-517f-404e-6c34-870983ab66e8",

        "modified": "2013-01-02T12:34:56+01:00"
    }
]
```

A `X-Total-Records` HTTP header containing the total number of records is returned along with the response.

### Get a single group

```
GET /library/sourcegroups/<id>
GET /library/metricgroups/<id>
```

Returns a group object with its name, description and matching rules entries.

newly created item location.

### Expand query tuples

```

A query tuple consists of a list of 3 values: origin, source and metric.

When querying the back-end, both source and metric fields can be a reference to a group, then beginning with `group:`
prefix.
