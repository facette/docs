# API Documentation

## General Information

This documentation describes the RESTful web API coming along with Facette web front-end.

Unless otherwise stated, all requests and responses bodies use `application/json` as `Content-Type`. The format is
described in the [RFC 4627][0] document.

### Dates and Times

The dates returned by the API are using the [RFC 3399][1] timestamp format.

### Filter Patterns

Some of the API calls can take a filter as optional parameter, those filters can be:

 * a [match][2] pattern (e.g. `glob:host*`)
 * a [regexp][3] pattern (e.g. `regexp:host[13]\.example\.net`)
 * a simple value (e.g. `host1.example.net`)

### Message Responses

When the API is unable to handle the received request or if an error occurred during its processing, a JSON message
response is sent along with an HTTP status code.

For example, if an unknown resource (e.g. origin, sourceâ€¦) is requested upon the API, with an HTTP status code being
`404 Not Found`, the response would look like:

```javascript
{
    "message": "Unable to find requested resource"
}
```
