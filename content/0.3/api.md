# API Documentation

## General Information

This documentation describes the RESTful web API exposed by the Facette back-end and used by the web front-end.

Unless otherwise stated, all requests and responses bodies use `application/json` as `Content-Type`. The format is
described in the [RFC 4627][0] document.

### Dates and Times

The dates returned by the API are using the [RFC 3399][1] timestamp format.

Some of the API calls can specify a `range` parameter accepting the format `[-]<number>{y,mo,d,h,m,s}`. For example,
the last day can be expressed with the following expressions:

 * `-1d`
 * `-24h`
 * `-1440m`
 * `-86400s`

It is also possible to combine multiple units, such as `-1h30m`.


### Filter Patterns

Some of the API calls can take a filter as optional parameter, those filters can be:

 * a [match][2] pattern (e.g. `glob:host*`)
 * a [regexp][3] pattern (e.g. `regexp:host[13]\.example\.net`)
 * a simple value (e.g. `host1.example.net`)

### Message Responses

When the API is unable to handle the received request or if an error occurred during its processing, a JSON message
response is sent along with an HTTP status code.

For example, if an unknown resource (e.g. origin, sourceâ€¦) is requested upon the API, with an HTTP status code being
`404 Not Found`, the response would look like:

```javascript
{
   "message": "Unable to find requested resource"
}
```

## Documents

 * [Server API](/api/server): access server related data and methods
 * [Catalog API](/api/catalog): retrieve information about existing origins, sources and metrics
 * [Library API](/api/library): manage library items (e.g. groups, charts and collections)
 * [Plots API](/api/plots): retrieve graph plots
 * [Status](/api/status): list of API HTTP response status codes
