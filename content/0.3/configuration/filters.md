# Filters

Facette *filters* allow you to change how *origins*, *sources* and *metrics* appear in the Facette catalog, and
discard the ones you don't want to deal with. The `filters` section of a *provider* definition defines rules that are
evaluated at *origins* inventory, renaming or discarding specific *sources* or *metrics* using regular expressions
([RE2 syntax][0]).

<div class="note"><span class="fa fa-info-circle"></span> <strong>Note:</strong> in JSON you need to double the
escaping character <code>\</code> when writing regular expressions
(e.g. <code>\d</code>&nbsp;â†’&nbsp;<code>\\d</code>).</div>

Filter rule settings:

 * `action` (_string_): action to perform on the processed records (see "Actions" section)
 * `target` (_string_): object to target (`origin`, `source`, `metric` or `all`)
 * `pattern` (_string_): pattern to match
 * `into` (_string_): replacement pattern

Supported `target` (_string_) values:

 * `all`: match filter `pattern` on all names (default)
 * `origin`: match filter `pattern` on *origin* names only
 * `source`: match filter `pattern` on *source* names only
 * `metric`: match filter `pattern` on *metric* names only

<div class="note"><span class="fa fa-info-circle"></span> <strong>Note:</strong> in case of a pattern regexp syntax
error, the filter will continue its initialization and discard the bogus rule (a warning message will be output in the
logs).</div>

## Actions

### rewrite

Rewrite all received records `target` field by replacing all occurrences of `pattern` with the string value
specified in the `rewrite` setting (can also be regular expression captured groups references).

Example: rewrite sources (such as "host3_example_net" becomes "host3.example.net"), and metrics (such as
"cpu-0.cpu.system.value" becomes "cpu.0.system"):

```javascript
"filters": [
  { "action": "rewrite", "target": "source", "pattern": "_", "into": "." },
  { "action": "rewrite", "target": "metric", "pattern": "^cpu-(\\d+)\\.cpu-(.+)\\.value$", "into": "cpu.$1.$2" }
]
```

### discard

Discard all received records whose `target` match `pattern`.

Example: discard all entries whose *source* match the pattern "host3.example.net"

```javascript
"filters": [
  { "action": "discard", "target": "source", "pattern": "host3\\.example\\.net" }
]
```

### sieve

The *sieve* action does the opposite of *discard*: it only lets records whose `target` match `pattern` pass through.

Example: only keep records whose *source* names end with ".prod.example.net"

```javascript
"filters": [
  { "action": "sieve", "target": "source", "pattern": "\\.prod\\.example\\.net$" }
]
```

## Precedence

When evaluating filtering chains, the precedence of actions is the following:

```
Sieve > Discard > Rewrite
```

<div class="note"><span class="fa fa-info-circle"></span> <strong>Note:</strong> filtering rules are evaluated in the
order you define them, so watch out for ordering issues when defining "chained" rules, as a
<em>origin</em>/<em>source</em>/<em>metric</em> name may have been previously rewritten and a subsequent rule pattern
may not match its original value.</div>
